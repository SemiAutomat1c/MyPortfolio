# Building a GCash Transaction Verifier

As online scams become more sophisticated, I noticed a growing need for tools to verify digital transactions. This led me to create the GCash Transaction Verifier, a web application that helps users verify the authenticity of GCash transactions.

## The Problem

Many people fall victim to fake GCash transaction screenshots. Scammers often use edited images to:
- Fake payment confirmations
- Create false proof of transfers
- Manipulate transaction details

## The Solution

I developed a web-based tool that:
1. Analyzes transaction screenshots
2. Verifies key elements like:
   - Transaction ID format
   - Date and time consistency
   - Visual authenticity markers

## Technical Implementation

The project uses several modern technologies:

```typescript
// Example of transaction ID validation
function validateTransactionId(id: string): boolean {
  // GCash transaction IDs follow a specific pattern
  const pattern = /^[0-9]{12}$/;
  return pattern.test(id);
}
```

## Future Improvements

I'm planning to add:
- Machine learning for better image analysis
- API integration with GCash (if possible)
- Batch verification for multiple transactions

Stay tuned for more updates on this project!
